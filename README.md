## 🧠 What’s Inside

### 1. **AI and AI Alignment**
- Definition and contrast: *Human Intelligence vs Artificial Intelligence (AI)*
- Core challenge: Aligning AI systems with human values
- Real-world relevance: Why companies like OpenAI and DeepMind focus on this

### 2. **Prompt Engineering**
- What a "prompt" is in the context of AI
- Types of prompts: Exploratory, Task-specific, Research-driven, Creative
- The role of context in crafting effective prompts
- How prompt engineering serves as a practical tool for achieving **AI alignment on a local/user level**

### 3. **User Roles and Prompt Types**
- Learners → interactive and exploratory prompts
- Executors → deterministic and specific prompts
- Researchers → knowledge-driven, contextual prompting
- Writers → creative, style-focused prompting
