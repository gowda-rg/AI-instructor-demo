## ✅Summary for  Reflection

---

### 🔹 **1. What is AI?**

* AI = Simulation of human intelligence using machines.
* Core functions include: **learning**, **reasoning**, **problem-solving**, **perception**, and **language understanding**.
* AI mimics but doesn’t fully replicate **human intelligence**.
* Critical thought: *“If AI can do everything, why should humans still learn AI?”*

---

### 🔹 **2. What is AI Alignment?**

* AI systems often act like **black boxes**—we know inputs and outputs, but not always the reasoning inside.
* **AI alignment** means ensuring AI behaves in a way that matches **collective human values**.
* Misaligned AI can produce technically correct but **ethically or socially harmful** outcomes.
* Real-world tension: *“Should we trust systems whose decisions we don’t fully understand?”*

### 🔹 **3. What is Prompting?**

* Prompting = Framing inputs to guide and align AI’s outputs with your intended result.
* It’s not just “asking”—it’s **engineering** your queries for precision, clarity, and alignment.
* Prompting helps individuals **bridge gaps in alignment** themselves—like personal safety gear in the AI world.
* Prompt types: **Exploratory**, **Task-oriented**, **Recursive**, **Creative**, **Role-based**, etc.

This table breaks down the different types of prompts, focusing on their **primary function** and **distinctive feature**.

| **Prompt Type**              | **Distinction**                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Question**              | Requests specific information or clarification.                                |
| **2. Command**               | Instructs the AI to perform a specific action.                                 |
| **3. Query**                 | Seeks to retrieve specific data or results, often from a database.             |
| **4. Statement**             | Provides context or information without asking for a response.                 |
| **5. Inquiry**               | Explores a topic, often broader and more open-ended than a question.           |
| **6. Request**               | Politely asks for something to be done or created.                             |
| **7. Explanation**           | Seeks a detailed explanation or description of a concept.                      |
| **8. Scenario/Hypothetical** | Presents a "what-if" situation to explore outcomes.                            |
| **9. Creative Generation**   | Requests the AI to generate original, creative content (e.g., stories, poems). |
| **10. Role-Based Prompt**    | Assigns a specific role to the AI, e.g., expert, interviewer.                  |
| **11. Clarification**        | Seeks further explanation to clear up ambiguity or confusion.                  |
| **12. Feedback Prompt**      | Asks for an evaluation or improvement suggestions.                             |
| **13. Comparison**           | Requests a comparison or contrast between two or more items.                   |
| **14. Multi-step Prompt**    | Guides through a series of tasks or steps to reach a goal.                     |
| **15. System Prompt**        | Internal instructions for the AI to guide its behavior or tone.                |
