**What is `AI alignment`?**
AI has a dual nature:

* One is that it is aligned with human values and intentions — *AI alignment successful*.
* The other nature of AI is that it is not aligned with human values and intentions — *AI misalignment*.

This is the core challenge that is being faced by top AI companies like \[company names can be inserted here].

A **prompt engineer** can solve the issue of AI alignment, at least for their own prompts.
We have understood that the alignment issue can be solved by the prompter for their prompts, if not for all of humanity.

**What is a prompt?**
A prompt can be anything that you write in the AI user interface. Any input that you send to AI models is considered a prompt.
This prompt can be one line, one word, detailed, task-oriented, exploration-oriented, information-gathering-oriented—anything that you put and send as input to the AI is considered a prompt.

So, a prompt can be a query, a search, a question, an order, a command, etc.

**Then what is prompt engineering?**
Engineering/designing prompts in such a way that the AI response aligns with your expected output for all your prompts—this is called prompt engineering.

Prompt engineering has many definitions since it covers all domains. It is the bridge between all domains and the one meta-domain: AI.

**For example:**
What is prompt engineering for a software engineer?
Prompt engineering is context-oriented.

**What we have explored so far:**

* Definitions (many)
* There are many types of prompts

One is a **learner** — can design exploratory prompts for exploring, learning, and having an interactive learning experience.

The other is a **task executor** — must design specific prompts based on the task requirement. Here, the specificity of the response matters (it's a kind of deterministic logic where the output must be specific).

Another one is a **researcher** — this also depends on the researcher’s contextual knowledge.
**Writer**, and many other roles.

There are many types of prompts, but broadly speaking, all types of inquiries can be transformed into prompts.

So now, the concept of prompt engineering comes into play.
